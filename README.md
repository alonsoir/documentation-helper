# LangChain Documentation Helper

A repository for learning LangChain by building a generative ai application. Original work from Eden Marco.

This is a web application demo that use Pinecone as a vectorstore and answers questions about LangChain.
Pinecone act a context database, first you have to download the docs from sources from LangChain official documentation. 
Obviously you can do the same with every dataset you want.  

Basically you have three scripts in this project:

langchain_retrieval_doc_helper.py --> my work. Original work from Eden was not working for me.
main.py --> it invokes the logic from core_agent.py
core_agent.py --> basically is a refactor from first script.
